/**
 * Whole-file credential masking (Linux).
 *
 * For a `credentials.files` entry with `mode: "mask"`, srt reads the real
 * file content on the host, registers a sentinel for it in the
 * {@link SentinelRegistry}, and writes the sentinel to a fake file in a
 * manager-owned temp directory. The Linux sandbox then `--ro-bind`s the
 * fake over the real path, so the sandboxed process reads the sentinel.
 * The proxy substitution from env-var masking already scans every header
 * for any registered sentinel, so a tool that does
 * `Authorization: Bearer $(cat <maskedFile>)` reaches the upstream with
 * the real bytes — no proxy changes required.
 *
 * On macOS, SBPL cannot redirect reads, so masked files degrade to
 * `mode: "deny"` (see macos-sandbox-utils.ts).
 *
 * LIMITATION: this is whole-file masking. It works when the file content
 * *is* the credential (a token file). It does not work for structured
 * files a tool parses (JSON/YAML/.netrc) — the tool will fail to parse
 * the sentinel. See {@link CredentialFileConfigSchema}.
